Who goes there?\n ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, Sovereign of all England!\n SOLDIER #1:  Pull the other one!\n ARTHUR:  I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.\n SOLDIER #1:  What? Ridden on a horse?\n ARTHUR:  Yes!\n SOLDIER #1:  You're using coconuts!\n ARTHUR:  What?\n SOLDIER #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.\n ARTHUR:  So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through--\n SOLDIER #1:  Where'd you get the coconuts?\n ARTHUR:  We found them.\n SOLDIER #1:  Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!\n ARTHUR:  What do you mean?\n SOLDIER #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone."

		content: "ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?\n SOLDIER #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? Not at all. They could be carried.\n SOLDIER #1:  What? A swallow carrying a coconut?\n ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk\n SOLDIER #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not	carry a one pound coconut.\n ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?\n SOLDIER #1:  Listen. In order to maintain air-speed	velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every	second, right?\n ARTHUR:  Please!\n SOLDIER #1:  Am I right?\n ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!\n SOLDIER #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!\n SOLDIER #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow. Thats my point.\n SOLDIER #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\n ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my	court at Camelot?!\n SOLDIER #1:  But then of course, uh, African swallows are	non-migratory.\n SOLDIER #2:  Oh, yeah.\n SOLDIER #1:  So, they couldn't bring a coconut back	anyway.\n [clop clop clop]\n SOLDIER #2:  Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?\n SOLDIER #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.\n SOLDIER #2:  Well, simple! They'd just use a strand ofcreeper!\n SOLDIER #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?\n SOLDIER #2:  Well, why not?"
